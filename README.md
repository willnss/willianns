💚 I'm a web developer with over 10 years of experience who likes to learn new technologies to craft and deliver value through software.

 🐱‍🏍 My experience includes mostly back-end enginering w/ ASP.NET/C# (.NET Framework/.NET Core) & SQL Server, and front-end w/ Javascript using mainly jQuery & ReactJS among other back-end and front-end techonologies. 

🚀 I also like to try new languages ​​like Elixir, F#. Currently I have focused efforts on expanding knowledge in cloud architecture in general and container orchestration to build scalable solutions.
